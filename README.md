# SIS — Student Information System

A compact, developer-friendly README for this repository (SIS). I inspected the repository layout and prepared this README to match the project's technology mix: a Java backend built with Maven (Backend/), and a JavaScript frontend (Frontend/) with CSS/HTML.

About
-----
SIS is a Student Information System project combining:
- A Java backend (Maven project) located in the `Backend/` directory.
- A JavaScript frontend (UI) located in the `Frontend/` directory, styled with CSS and HTML.

This README gives exact commands and practical guidance to build, run, test, and contribute based on the repository layout.

Repository layout
----------------
(Observed from the repo root)
- Backend/
  - .mvn/
  - mvnw, mvnw.cmd
  - pom.xml
  - src/ (Java source)
- Frontend/
  - (frontend project files — package.json expected)
- .gitattributes, .gitignore (under Backend/ as observed)

Note: adapt any directory names below if the project uses different subfolder names.

Prerequisites
-------------
- Git
- Java JDK 11+ (or the version required by the project)
- Maven (optional — the project includes wrapper scripts)
- Node.js 14+ and npm or yarn (for the frontend)
- Docker & docker-compose (optional, if you add containerization)

Backend (Java / Maven)
----------------------

Build
```bash
# from repository root
cd Backend

# Unix / macOS
./mvnw clean package

# Windows (PowerShell / CMD)
mvnw.cmd clean package
```

Notes:
- The wrapper (mvnw) will download the correct Maven version defined by the project.
- The packaged artifact will be in `Backend/target/` (for example `target/*.jar`).

Run
```bash
# From Backend/ you can usually run
# If the project is Spring Boot or produces an executable jar:
java -jar target/*.jar

# Or run via the wrapper (if configured):
./mvnw spring-boot:run
# Windows:
mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

If the backend uses a different main class or a standard WAR, run it with your application server or your chosen method.

Test
```bash
# Run unit & integration tests
cd Backend
./mvnw test        # Unix/macOS
# or
mvnw.cmd test      # Windows
```

Frontend (JavaScript / CSS / HTML)
----------------------------------

Install & run (development)
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
npm start
# or, if the project uses yarn:
# yarn install
# yarn start
```

Build (production)
```bash
cd Frontend
npm run build
# or
# yarn build
```

Test
```bash
cd Frontend
npm test
# or yarn test
```

Configuration & environment variables
-------------------------------------
The backend may read configuration from application.properties/application.yml or environment variables. Common variables to configure:
- DATABASE_URL or JDBC_DATABASE_URL — JDBC connection string (e.g., jdbc:postgresql://host:5432/sis)
- DB_USER / DB_PASSWORD — DB credentials
- SERVER_PORT — backend port (default often 8080)
- FRONTEND_URL / CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS — frontend origin during development
- JWT_SECRET or SECRET_KEY — for token-based auth (if present)

For the frontend:
- API_BASE_URL — base URL for backend API (e.g., http://localhost:8080/api)

Add a .env or update your local configuration according to how the project reads env vars (application.properties, .env, or directly via build tooling).

API examples
------------
Common REST endpoints that a Student Information System backend typically exposes (adjust to actual implementation):
- GET /api/students — list students
- GET /api/students/{id} — get student by id
- POST /api/students — create student
- PUT /api/students/{id} — update student
- DELETE /api/students/{id} — delete student

Example student JSON
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "firstName": "Jane",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "jane.doe@example.edu",
  "enrolledCourses": [
    { "courseId": "CS101", "term": "Fall2025" }
  ]
}
```

Authentication
--------------
If the backend requires Bearer tokens:
```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```

Development workflow
--------------------
- Create a feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feat/short-description
```
- Keep commits small and focused.
- Run tests locally before opening a pull request.
- Push branch and open a PR against `main` (or `develop` if used).

Contributing
------------
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a topic branch for your changes.
3. Implement changes and include tests where appropriate.
4. Run backend & frontend tests locally.
5. Open a pull request with a descriptive title and a summary of changes.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- Backend can't connect to DB: verify JDBC URL, DB credentials, and that the DB is running.
- Port conflict: change `SERVER_PORT` or the port used by the frontend dev server.
- Frontend CORS errors: ensure backend CORS settings allow the frontend origin in development.
- Build failure: check Java version and dependency resolution in `pom.xml`.

License & authors
-----------------
- Add or update LICENSE (MIT suggested if you want permissive open source).
- Maintainer: Kushagra6009
- Add contributors and acknowledgements as needed.

-------
Open issues on the repository for bugs, feature requests, or questions.

Notes on what I inspected
-------------------------
I inspected the repository structure and confirmed a Maven-based Java backend under `Backend/` (includes `pom.xml`, `mvnw`, `.mvn/`, and `src/`) and a frontend project under `Frontend/`. The README above is tailored to that composition and contains concrete commands using the project's wrapper scripts and typical frontend commands.

If you'd like, I can:
- tailor the backend run instructions to the exact Spring Boot artifact name (if it is Spring Boot), or
- detect and add exact npm scripts from Frontend/package.json and embed them here.
